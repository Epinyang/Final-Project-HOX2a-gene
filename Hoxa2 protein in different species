#How to create a Phylogenetic tree for the HOXa2 protein


INTRO
Homeobox genes are found on separate chromosomes in groups A, B, C, and D. The HOXA2 (Homeobox A2), which is part of group A and located on chromosome 7, gene 
is known to regulate gene expression, morphogenesis, and differentiation. It also places hindbrain segments in the proper location along the anterior-posterior 
axis during embryonic development. My biological question will show which animals have the gene HOXA2 and their relation to Mus musculus (house mouse).



#INFO
Look up the Hoxa2 gene under the HomoloGene search bar. This will bring up all the species that have that gene. 

#CODE USED EACH TIME FOR EACH DATASET
1. #Create environment: Conda activate /project/stuckert/epinyang/phylo_lab/Hoxa2_datasets
2. #Create a directory where the FASTA files for each species' Hoxa2 protein sequence will resort: mkdir Hoxa_project
3. #Open directory: cd Hoxa_project 
4. #Get datasets from the NCBI website for 5 different species of animals (including Mus musculus) that also have the Hoxa2 gene:
        Download them to your computer and copy the sequence each time you are creating the FASTA file and past as its text
5. #Create a FASTA file for each species: nano Species_hoxa2.fa
6. #combine FASTA files: cat file1.fa file2.fa > combined.fa
7. #To check the combined fasta file: cat combined.fa 
8. mafft 
9. #Make the tree: iqtree -s Hoxa2_output.fa -m LG -bb 1000 -pre Hoxa2_output.fa
